# Sudoku-Solver

GUI Interface receives your sudoku of choice or chooses one for you and find it's solution.

## About

As I found the [Eel Repository](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel) here on Github, I had the idea to create a Sudoku Solver to learn more about algorithms using my main programming language (Python) and learn more about JavaScript, HTML and CSS

## Algorithm

Using the Backtracking Algorithm (also known as Brute Force), I could find solutions for all sudokus in a reasonable amount of time.

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Programming Language used (I also used JavaScript, HTML and CSS).
* [Eel](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel) - Main library used on this project
* [Sudoku Database](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/sudoku)
* [Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms) - Where I found Algorithms to solve my sudoku
